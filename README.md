# Superhero Eye Color Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project explores superhero eye color distribution using Pandas for data cleaning and Matplotlib for visualization. We analyze a dataset of superheroes, filtering for only "good" aligned characters and identifying the most common eye colors among them.

**Key Objectives**
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing dataset.
- Filtering: Extracting relevant superhero attributes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying the most common superhero eye colors.
- Data Visualization: Plotting a bar chart to showcase eye color distribution.

**Dataset Description**
- heroes_information.csv: Contains superhero attributes like name, eye color, alignment, and other demographic details.

**Methodology**

**1. Data Cleaning & Preparation*
- Filtered relevant columns (Name, Eye Color, Alignment).
- Kept only "good" superheroes, removing neutral and bad alignments.
- Handled missing values, removing superheroes without an eye color.
  
**2. Analysis & Insights**
- Identified top 5 most common superhero eye colors.
- Created a bar chart visualization showcasing the distribution of eye colors among superheroes.

**3. Key Findings**
- Blue eyes are the most common among superheroes.
- Brown and green eyes follow as the next most frequent.
- Unique colors like red and white appear but are less common.
  
**Tools Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing
- Matplotlib for visualization.
